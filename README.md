# Topic Types

This repository stores code for EscolaLMS Content Topic types. At the moment there are the following types:

- **Audio**.
- **H5P**. [Reusable Interactive HTML5 Content](https://h5p.org/)
- **Image**.
- **oEmbed**. oEmbed is a format for allowing an [embedded representation](https://oembed.com/) of a URL on third party sites.
- **RichText**. Markdown rich texts. Like github readme files
- **Video**. Video with possible conversion to HLS format.
- **PDF**.

Those types are used for building headless Course.

It's possible to add any new content type, for example HTML Text.
